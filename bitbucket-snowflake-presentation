Core Requirements:
Enables automated deployment of Snowflake database changes using Bitbucket Pipelines

Developers push SQL changes (DDL/DML) to the Bitbucket repository

When a feature branch is merged into main, the pipeline is triggered

The pipeline allows one-click deployment of changes:

First to the QA environment

Then optionally to Production

üõ†Ô∏è Additional Functionality (One-Time Setup):
Capability to extract DDL for all database objects from an existing Snowflake database

Used for initial setup or reverse-engineering before Bitbucket integration is in place

Not part of the live CI/CD workflow but a helpful pre-integration utility
